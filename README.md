This code simulates how hot an electronic device gets during a short burst of extra power. The device has a special heat sink that uses a material that can change phases to absorb extra heat.

The code defines properties of the materials involved (electronics, heat sink, phase change material) and how heat moves around. Then it simulates the temperature rise due to the power surge and shows how the phase change material helps keep things cool.
